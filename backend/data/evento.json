When creating a leadership development program, think about how you can place participants into situations that will require them to learn and grow. Examples include giving candidates the opportunity to step up when other leaders are away or to collaborate with colleagues in other departments on a special project. Mentoring, training and organizational planning, with individual activities such as job rotation, job shadowing and project leadership, are often components of effective leadership development programs.

The first step you must take when having made a poor choice is to recognize the part you played in a situation. It does no good at all to make excuses or rationalize or pretend that, for whatever reason, you aren't to blame. If you want to move forward from wherever you've found yourself, you have to take responsibility for your choices and actions. Keep in mind that this is not a time to think of excuses for why it happened; this is a time to understand why it happened so you can avoid making similar decisions in the future. In this lecture, we will also learn how to apologize and explain, focus on the present and be proactive in the future.",

Executives from all industries admit to being torn: How can they respond constructively to failures without giving rise to an anything-goes attitude?

The first line requires express and uses the express variable to represent it. The second line initialized express using the brackets which initializes an express server and puts the initialized server into the variable app. So now whenever we want to use our express server, we would need to use the app variable which represents our app! We then set our app to listen to port 3000 and create a callback function that says our server is running on port 3000. Join the event to continue the lesson!",

This version was a re-write of the prototyping and scaffolding tool, going back to why Vue was built in the first place: ease of use. The need to re-write the CLI tool came mostly from the fact that developers struggled with a lot of configurations while trying to setup Vue projects. There was also this push to bring about even more clarity about setting up tools at the start of any Vue project. With the new CLI version, you do not really need a full fledged project with all the configs. Sometimes, you just want to work on a single component and see it run on a local development server. Good news! the new Vue CLI lets you do exactly that. Join the event to learn more.",

Whether you’re a seasoned manager or relatively new to the ranks, you may have learned the hard way that the skills that helped you move up the ladder aren’t necessarily the skills you need for successful leadership. It's not unusual to see new managers stumble early on as they stretch beyond their previous roles. Perhaps stellar technical skills helped you get a promotion to team lead, but in a managerial role you'll be relying much more heavily on interpersonal communication skills. In this lecture, we will talk about your ability to affect change and how it is ultimately dependent on relationships and networks.",

As we grow increasingly more connected through technology and social media, it is becoming more and more difficult to separate work from our personal lives. It is commonplace to check emails at all hours, take business calls at the dinner table and work on our laptops on weekends. How has this become acceptable?
